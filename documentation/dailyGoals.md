# Daily Goals

## 9/28/2020

* Add a log-in component to render a log-in form
  - Start-time: 9:00 am
  - End-time: 9:15 am
* Set up the backend routes for log-in
  - Had an issue with a 403 error whenever I tried to use a PUT/POST request. This was happening because in the app.js file for the backend, I was using csrf with the app but I was not passing in any csrf token with the response. For now I have commented out the csrf use statement and I will comment it back in at a later time when I am ready to use csrf protection.
  - Start-time: 9:15 am

  - Update component to use action and reducer to store user info in state after log-in
    - Start-time: 1:10 pm
    - End-time: 1:33 pm
  - Write code to log-in user.
    - Had issues with infinite re-renders because I was trying to use the token in the cookie to load up the user info and store that in state from the app component. It was stuck repeating the part of the code that loaded the data from the token. So I remember that in one project we used the cookie in the reducer to set up a default state. Once I did that everything worked fine. Once a token is stored, the user information can be accessed in the home component via the store.
